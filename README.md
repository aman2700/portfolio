Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository
Delete any local repository you have, if necessary.
Clone your GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aman2700/portfolio.git
Navigate into the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd portfolio
Step 2: Add Your Portfolio Files
Ensure your index.html, test.css, and test.js files are in the cloned repository directory.

Step 3: Add and Commit Changes
Stage the changes:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit"
Step 4: Push to GitHub
Push your changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Navigate to Settings > Pages.
Under "Source", select the main branch, then click Save.
GitHub will generate a link like https://aman2700.github.io/portfolio/, where your site will be hosted.
Step 6: Verify
Wait a few minutes, and visit the link generated by GitHub Pages. You should see your portfolio live.
